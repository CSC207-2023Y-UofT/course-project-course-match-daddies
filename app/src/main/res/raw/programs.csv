Accounting Specialist (BCom) - ASSPE2676,"Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto offers an innovative curriculum combining studies in management, economics, and the liberal arts for an enriched professional undergraduate experience. The program explores the role of commerce in modern society while developing skill and confidence in analysis, effective communication, and decision making. The Rotman Commerce program offers a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree in three different specialist programs, Finance & Economics, Accounting, and Management. All programs within the Bachelor of Commerce degree build on a common foundation of business and liberal arts courses. Rotman Commerce students specialize in one of three programs: Accounting, Finance and Economics, or Management. Each program combines courses in management and applied economics with a variety of advanced courses in the liberal arts and sciences. The balance assures graduates of a solid understanding of business and modern society along with a command of critical skills in decision-making and organizational leadership. Rotman Commerce graduates frequently become economists, accountants, actuaries, financial analysts, marketing analysts, managers of firms and government, or proprietors of small businesses. Some Rotman Commerce students elect to undertake post-graduate studies in the form of further university education: law schools and MBA programs have been particularly favoured destinations of recent graduates.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Animal Physiology Major (Science Program) - ASMAJ1538,"Students learn to compare and contrast the physiological systems of different animal species, or of a single species under difference environmental conditions. This experimental science strives to understand how physiological systems allow animals to adapt to their individual and ever-changing environments. Through a systems-level approach, from molecules to organisms, students gain an understanding of how emergent properties arise when physiological components operate as a whole. After foundational courses in first and second year, students participate in advanced lecture, seminar and laboratory courses, and are encouraged to apply for research project courses in the laboratories of the Department. Course offerings include neurophysiology, respiratory physiology, endocrinology, sleep physiology and comparative cellular physiology.","Enrolment Requirements: This is an open enrolment program. A student who has completed 4.0 credits may enrol in the program. Students in this program have the option to request enrolment in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) stream. Students can apply for the ASIP stream after Year 1 (Year 2 entry) or after Year 2 (Year 3 entry, starting Fall 2024).

Asian Canadian Studies Minor (Arts Program) - ASMIN2728,"The Minor in Asian Canadian Studies focuses on community-engaged learning that explores how to understand the historical, social, cultural, economic, and political forces that affect people of Asian heritage in Canada. Our interdisciplinary courses connect students with local communities, and every course provides opportunities for students to pursue a choice of research interests. Together we critically investigate and add to knowledge about Asian Canadians. The category ""Asian Canadian"" is widely understood to refer to people in Canada of East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian ancestry. Students take two required 0.5 credit core courses in Asian Canadian Studies; select from an array of courses in Asian Canadian Studies; and take additional courses related to the larger contexts of Asian Canadian Studies. The Minor in Asian Canadian Studies is easily combined with other disciplines, such as Anthropology, Art, Economics, English, Geography, History, Political Science and Sociology, as well as with interdisciplinary studies such as Contemporary Asian Studies, Diaspora and Transnational Studies, Equity Studies, East Asian Studies, South Asian Studies, and Near Eastern Studies. Students will be encouraged to take full advantage of the opportunities available through the Canadian Studies Program, including its journal, ImagiNATIONs, produced by and for undergraduate students and its annual undergraduate student conference. The Canadian Studies Student Union is a focal point for social as well as academic pursuits, and is open to students pursuing a Minor in Asian Canadian Studies. Students also can participate in Asian Canadian Studies student events and in the tri-campus Asian Canadian Studies Research network. The Research network brings together professors and students to discuss current research related to Asian Canadian Studies, Asian diasporas, and global Asian migrations. Students in the minor are also invited to participate in the Asian Institute’s Asian Pathways Research Lab that offers research opportunities in Toronto.",Enrolment Requirements: This is an open enrolment program.

Asian Canadian Studies Minor (Arts Program) - ASMIN2728,"The Minor in Asian Canadian Studies focuses on community-engaged learning that explores how to understand the historical, social, cultural, economic, and political forces that affect people of Asian heritage in Canada. Our interdisciplinary courses connect students with local communities, and every course provides opportunities for students to pursue a choice of research interests. Together we critically investigate and add to knowledge about Asian Canadians. The category ""Asian Canadian"" is widely understood to refer to people in Canada of East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian ancestry. Students take two required 0.5 credit core courses in Asian Canadian Studies; select from an array of courses in Asian Canadian Studies; and take additional courses related to the larger contexts of Asian Canadian Studies. The Minor in Asian Canadian Studies is easily combined with other disciplines, such as Anthropology, Art, Economics, English, Geography, History, Political Science and Sociology, as well as with interdisciplinary studies such as Contemporary Asian Studies, Diaspora and Transnational Studies, Equity Studies, East Asian Studies, South Asian Studies, and Near Eastern Studies. Students will be encouraged to take full advantage of the opportunities available through the Canadian Studies Program, including its journal, ImagiNATIONs, produced by and for undergraduate students and its annual undergraduate student conference. The Canadian Studies Student Union is a focal point for social as well as academic pursuits, and is open to students pursuing a Minor in Asian Canadian Studies. Students also can participate in Asian Canadian Studies student events and in the tri-campus Asian Canadian Studies Research network. The Research network brings together professors and students to discuss current research related to Asian Canadian Studies, Asian diasporas, and global Asian migrations. Students in the minor are also invited to participate in the Asian Institute’s Asian Pathways Research Lab that offers research opportunities in Toronto.",Enrolment Requirements: This is an open enrolment program.

Biological Physics Specialist (Science Program),"The Biological Physics specialist program focuses on the physical principles that underlie the organization of complex biological systems. How do cells use energy input to complex and dynamic molecular structures? How do cells overcome noise to transmit information and measure molecular concentrations on the nanoscale? How do millions of cells in the immune system coordinate precise responses to viruses and bacteria? How do neurons in the nervous system transmit and process information? How does blood flow through a beating heart? Biological Physics deals with problems at the interface of Physics, Molecular Biology, and Physiology, and covers the full range of scales, from the molecular, to the organismic. Students in this program will be trained to think rigorously and quantitatively about a wide range of interdisciplinary problems, will be well prepared to work in a variety of fields such as medicine and biotechnology, and will be ready to undertake graduate work in the fast-emerging field of Biological Physics and its related specialties including Immunology, Physiology, Neuroscience, and Bioengineering. The program is offered as a partnership between the Departments of Physics, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Immunology, and Physiology (referred to as ""partner departments""). All students take the Core courses in Physics, Mathematics, Biology, Biochemistry, and Chemistry. The Core also includes specialized courses in Biological Physics ( PHY331H1,  PHY431H1) and a third-year laboratory course from one of the partner departments.

The senior research project course enables students to gain valuable research experience while working under the supervision of an individual faculty member in either a laboratory-based or a non-laboratory-based setting.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program. Students must have completed 8.0 credits and meet the requirements listed below to enroll. Students interested in this program should initially apply to the Specialist in Pharmacology & Biomedical Toxicology Program (ASSPE2340) after their first year of study. Students in ASSPE2340 will have the opportunity to move into the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist (ASSPE2573) following their second year of study. Students who have completed 4.0 to 7.5 credits cannot apply directly to ASSPE2573 and must first apply to ASSPE2340, using the following courses:  BIO120H1 and  BIO130H1 ( CHM135H1,  CHM136H1)/  CHM151Y1 1.0 credit from ( MAT135H1 and  MAT136H1)/  MAT137Y1/​  MAT157Y1/​ ( PHY131H1 and  PHY132H1)/ ( PHY151H1 and  PHY152H1) Students who have completed at least 8.0 credits and who are already enrolled in ASSPE2340 may enrol in ASSPE2573 themselves on ACORN. Students who have completed at least 8.0 credits but who are not already enrolled in ASSPE2340 must apply to ASSPE2573 using the following courses:  BIO120H1 and  BIO130H1 ( CHM135H1,  CHM136H1)/  CHM151Y1 1.0 credit from ( MAT135H1 and  MAT136H1)/  MAT137Y1/​  MAT157Y1/​ ( PHY131H1 and  PHY132H1)/ ( PHY151H1 and  PHY152H1)  PCL201H1 Variable Minimum Grade and Variable Minimum Grade AverageA minimum grade and minimum grade average in required courses are needed for entry, and this minimum changes each year depending on available spaces and the number of applicants. To ensure that students admitted to the program will be successful, applicants with a final grade lower than 65% in any of these courses, or a combined grade average lower than 75% in these required courses will not be considered for admission. Please note that obtaining this minimum final grade and minimum grade average does not guarantee admission to the program. Applications from students lacking numerical grades in one or more of the specified enrolment requirements, or students applying in their second or later years, may be considered on the basis of their entire academic record and the availability of space in the program. In addition to applying through ACORN, students applying in their second year or later are asked to please contact the department directly at undergrad.pharmtox@utoronto.ca, specify which program you would like to be considered for, and provide your student number. Please consult the Arts & Science Program Toolkit for more information on program enrolment. Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) Students in this program have the option to request enrolment in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) stream. Students can apply for the ASIP stream after Year 1 (Year 2 entry) or after Year 2 (Year 3 entry). Full details about ASIP, including student eligibility, selection and enrolment, are available in the ASIP section of the Arts & Science Academic Calendar. Please note that the majority of students enter ASIP in Fall term of Year 2. Space is more limited for Year 3 entry and there are program-specific year 3 entry enrolment requirements. Students applying for Year 3 entry must have been admitted to the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist in the Summer after Year 2 and completion of  PCL201H1 (with a minimum grade of 77%),  PSL300H1 and  PSL301H1. Notes: While it is difficult to predict what will be competitive course marks and average in a given year, based on previous years, the estimate is: course marks = mid 80s; average = mid 80s. Students wishing to enroll in the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist will initially apply to the Joint Specialist in Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology (ASSPE2340). After admission, students can then choose to transfer to the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist. First and second year courses are the same for all Specialist programs within the Department (ASSPE2082/ASSPE2340/ASSPE2573). Students cannot combine the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist with either departmental Major programs (Biomedical Toxicology or Pharmacology). Students wishing to enroll after their second year who have taken  PCL201H1 will be considered on a case by case basis. Successful completion of pre-requisite courses is required to enroll in upper level program courses. Students may not transfer to the Major program from the Specialist after completion of  PCL474Y1 or  INT300H1/​ INT301H1 in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP).","Completion Requirements: (14.0 credits) First Year:  BIO120H1,  BIO130H1, ( CHM135H1,  CHM136H1)/  CHM151Y1, and 1.0 credit from any combination of ( MAT135H1,  MAT136H1)/  MAT137Y1/​  MAT157Y1,  PHY131H1/​  PHY151H1,  PHY132H1/​ PHY152H1 (see NOTE 1) Students in this program have the option to enrol in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) stream.

Critical Studies in Equity and Solidarity Major (Arts Program) - ASMAJ1141,"Critical Studies in Equity and Solidarity (CSES) is an interdisciplinary program that explores how social relations and practices of power and privilege are (re)produced locally and transnationally. In CSES we question the dominant conceptualization of equity by the state, educational programs, the non-profit sectors and community organizations as individualized and de-historicized social differences. CSES is a hub of critical disability studies teaching and learning. The program provides students with theoretical and practical tools to study social, political, economic and historical injustices. CSES takes a unique approach to undergraduate education that values student experiential learning and community knowledge. The learning goal of CSES is to provide frameworks on theories of transformative social change rooted in political activism and formations of solidarity. The program encourages students to apply theory in action through organizing and practicing solidarity in making a more just world. Equity Studies creates a dynamic learning environment that extends far beyond the university walls. With a vibrant student body, dynamic faculty members, connection with a wide range of community partners and a bold curriculum, CSES at New College is a leader in studies of social justice, settler colonialism, race, gender, sexuality, disability, land/water and sustainability, activism, solidarity and the art of resistance, and global food equity and security.",Enrolment Requirements: This is an open enrolment program.

Data Science Specialist (Science Program) - ASSPE1687,"The field of Data Science is a combination of statistics and computer science methodologies that enable ‘learning from data’. A data scientist extracts information from data, and is involved with every step that must be taken to achieve this goal, from getting acquainted with the data to communicating the results in non-technical language. The Data Science Specialist program prepares students for work in the Data Science industry or government and for graduate studies in Data Science, Computer Science, or Statistics. Students in the program will benefit from a range of advanced courses in Computer Science and Statistics offered by the University of Toronto, as well as from a sequence of three integrative courses designed especially for the program. The Data Science Specialist program comprises three fundamental and highly-integrated aspects. First, students will acquire expertise in statistical reasoning, methods, and inference essential for any data analyst. Seconds, students will receive in-depth training in computer science: the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for handling large amounts of data, and best practices in software design. Students will receive training in machine learning, which lies at the intersection of computer and statistical sciences. The third aspect is the application of computer science and statistics to produce analyses of complex, large-scale datasets, and the communication of the results of these analyses; students will receive training in these areas by taking integrative courses that are designed specifically for the Data Science Specialist program. The courses involve experiential learning: students will be working with real large-scale datasets from the domain of business, government, and/or science. The successful student will combine their expertise in computer and statistical science to produce and communicate analyses of complex large-scale datasets. Skills that graduates of the program will acquire include proficiency in statistical reasoning and computational thinking; data manipulation and exploration, visualization, and communication that are required for work as a data scientist; the ability to apply statistical methods to solve problems in the context of scientific research, business, and government; familiarity and experience with best practices in software development; and knowledge of current software infrastructure for handling large data sets. Graduates of the program will be able to demonstrate the ability to apply machine learning algorithms to large-scale datasets that arise in scientific research, government, and business; create appropriate data visualizations for complex datasets; identify and answer questions that involve applying statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to complex data, and communicating the results; present the results and limitations of a data analysis at an appropriate technical level for the intended audience.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Data Science Specialist (Science Program) - ASSPE1687,"The field of Data Science is a combination of statistics and computer science methodologies that enable ‘learning from data’. A data scientist extracts information from data, and is involved with every step that must be taken to achieve this goal, from getting acquainted with the data to communicating the results in non-technical language. The Data Science Specialist program prepares students for work in the Data Science industry or government and for graduate studies in Data Science, Computer Science, or Statistics. Students in the program will benefit from a range of advanced courses in Computer Science and Statistics offered by the University of Toronto, as well as from a sequence of three integrative courses designed especially for the program. The Data Science Specialist program comprises three fundamental and highly-integrated aspects. First, students will acquire expertise in statistical reasoning, methods, and inference essential for any data analyst. Seconds, students will receive in-depth training in computer science: the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for handling large amounts of data, and best practices in software design. Students will receive training in machine learning, which lies at the intersection of computer and statistical sciences. The third aspect is the application of computer science and statistics to produce analyses of complex, large-scale datasets, and the communication of the results of these analyses; students will receive training in these areas by taking integrative courses that are designed specifically for the Data Science Specialist program. The courses involve experiential learning: students will be working with real large-scale datasets from the domain of business, government, and/or science. The successful student will combine their expertise in computer and statistical science to produce and communicate analyses of complex large-scale datasets. Skills that graduates of the program will acquire include proficiency in statistical reasoning and computational thinking; data manipulation and exploration, visualization, and communication that are required for work as a data scientist; the ability to apply statistical methods to solve problems in the context of scientific research, business, and government; familiarity and experience with best practices in software development; and knowledge of current software infrastructure for handling large data sets. Graduates of the program will be able to demonstrate the ability to apply machine learning algorithms to large-scale datasets that arise in scientific research, government, and business; create appropriate data visualizations for complex datasets; identify and answer questions that involve applying statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to complex data, and communicating the results; present the results and limitations of a data analysis at an appropriate technical level for the intended audience.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program. Students must have completed 4.0 credits and meet the requirements listed below to enrol. For students admitted to Arts & Science in the Year 1 Computer Science (CMP1) admission category: Variable Minimum GradeA minimum grade is needed for entry, and this minimum changes each year depending on the number of applicants.

STA261H1 will be used in place of  STA130H1 for program admission purposes if a student has not completed  STA130H1 or if they have completed both  STA130H1 and  STA261H1 by the time they are being considered for admission. To ensure that students admitted to the program will be successful, applicants will not be considered for admission with a grade lower than 70% in  CSC110Y1,  MAT137Y1, and  STA130H1/​  STA261H1, or lower than 77% in  CSC111H1. ( MAT157Y1 grades will be adjusted to account for the course's greater difficulty.) Obtaining these minimum grades does not guarantee admission to the program. For students admitted to other Arts & Science Year 1 admission categories: Special Requirement Students who do not have the Computer Science Admission Guarantee must complete a supplementary application to be considered for the program. Variable Minimum GradeA minimum grade is needed for entry, and this minimum changes each year depending on available spaces and the number of applicants. The following courses must be completed:  CSC148H1  MAT137Y1/​  MAT157Y1  STA130H1/​  STA261H1* *  STA130H1 is restricted to first-year students, therefore students are strongly encouraged to take  STA130H1 in their first year.

To ensure that students admitted to the program will be successful, applicants with a grade lower than 70% will not be considered for admission. ( MAT157Y1 grades will be adjusted to account for the course's greater difficulty.) Obtaining these minimum grades does not guarantee admission to the program. Notes: Requests for admission will be considered in the first program request period only. Due to the limited enrolment nature of this program, students are strongly advised to plan to enroll in backup programs. Students admitted to the program after second or third year will be required to pay retroactive deregulated program fees. Arts & Science Internship Program Students in this program have the option to request enrolment in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) stream. Students can apply for the ASIP stream after Year 1 (Year 2 entry) or after Year 2 (Year 3 entry). Full details about ASIP, including student eligibility, selection and enrolment, are available in the ASIP section of the Arts & Science Academic Calendar. Please note that space is more limited for Year 3 entry and students applying for Year 3 entry must have been admitted to the Data Science Specialist in the Summer after Year 2.","Completion Requirements: (13.0-13.5 credits, including at least 1.5 credits at the 400-level) First year (3.0-3.5 credits)MAT137Y1/​ MAT157Y1,  MAT223H1/​ MAT240H1 ( MAT240H1 is recommended),  STA130H1, ( CSC108H1,  CSC148H1)/ ( CSC110Y1,  CSC111H1)Note: Students with a strong background in an object-oriented language such as Python, Java or C++ may omit  CSC108H1 and proceed directly with  CSC148H1.

Digital Humanities Minor (Arts Program) - ASMIN1337,"Digital humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing. DH studies human culture -- art, literature, history, geography, religion -- through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies the digital through humanist lenses. Digital humanists study social media phenomena or medieval manuscript archives; computationally analyze thousands of newspaper articles to trace economic developments; construct video games to study literary narratives; or resurrect historical cities through digital maps and virtual reality exhibits. In introductory and advanced DH courses, students learn about the intellectual landscape of digital humanities scholarship. They learn how to build digital stories, exhibits, and maps; how to digitize rare books; how to analyze collections of data; how to construct digital models and 3D-print them; and how to manage major digital projects. By the end of the program, students conduct a major DH research project of their own or participate in the research of an established faculty project. Throughout the program, students gain a critical perspective on digital technologies, learning to consider the ways digital platforms shape, and are shaped by, the currents of wider social and cultural forces. By providing this critical and technical skillset, the Digital Humanities Minor prepares students for future paths that range from graduate studies in literature, history, library science, education, or computer science, to careers as technical writers, data analysts and visualizers, project managers, or programmers. Students should note that some courses at the 200, 300, and 400 levels may have additional prerequisites. Permission to count courses that are not on the list below towards the Minor in Digital Humanities must be received from the Program Coordinator, and will be granted on a case-by-case basis when the student’s work demonstrably and substantially engages Digital Humanities-related content or research methods.",Enrolment Requirements: This is an open enrolment program.

Digital Humanities Minor (Arts Program) - ASMIN1337,"Digital humanities (DH) is a discipline at the intersections of the humanities with computing. DH studies human culture -- art, literature, history, geography, religion -- through computational tools and methodologies; and, in turn, DH studies the digital through humanist lenses. Digital humanists study social media phenomena or medieval manuscript archives; computationally analyze thousands of newspaper articles to trace economic developments; construct video games to study literary narratives; or resurrect historical cities through digital maps and virtual reality exhibits. In introductory and advanced DH courses, students learn about the intellectual landscape of digital humanities scholarship. They learn how to build digital stories, exhibits, and maps; how to digitize rare books; how to analyze collections of data; how to construct digital models and 3D-print them; and how to manage major digital projects. By the end of the program, students conduct a major DH research project of their own or participate in the research of an established faculty project. Throughout the program, students gain a critical perspective on digital technologies, learning to consider the ways digital platforms shape, and are shaped by, the currents of wider social and cultural forces. By providing this critical and technical skillset, the Digital Humanities Minor prepares students for future paths that range from graduate studies in literature, history, library science, education, or computer science, to careers as technical writers, data analysts and visualizers, project managers, or programmers. Students should note that some courses at the 200, 300, and 400 levels may have additional prerequisites.

Earth and Environmental Systems Major (Science Program) - ASMAJ2745,"In the Earth and Environmental Systems Major, students use multidisciplinary approaches to studying the large-scale interactions between the Earth and planetary systems over a broad spectrum of time-scales, addressing deep timescales of millions to billions of years as well as processes taking place in today’s and in future worlds. Courses take an integrative approach to understanding interactions between the solid Earth, the biosphere, the atmosphere and the hydrosphere, addressing how these interactions have developed over geological, historical, and recent time periods. Themes of the program include biogeochemistry, paleoclimatology (e.g., drivers of Earth’s natural climate variability), global environmental change, Quaternary science (e.g., understanding the ice ages) and Earth surface processes (e.g., evolution of landforms and sedimentary basins). This program provides broad context over time and space to better understand and provide solutions for the current issues of climate change, resource consumption and global pollution weighing heavily on people and societies. Students are advised to check course prerequisites, to review the clusters of courses listed, and to consult the Earth Sciences Undergraduate Handbook for logical course progressions.

Finance and Economics Specialist (BCom) - ASSPE2038,"Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto offers an innovative curriculum combining studies in management, economics, and the liberal arts for an enriched professional undergraduate experience. The program explores the role of commerce in modern society while developing skill and confidence in analysis, effective communication, and decision making. The Rotman Commerce program offers a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree in three different specialist programs, Finance & Economics, Accounting, and Management. All programs within the Bachelor of Commerce degree build on a common foundation of business and liberal arts courses. Rotman Commerce students specialize in one of three programs: Accounting, Finance and Economics, or Management. Each program combines courses in management and applied economics with a variety of advanced courses in the liberal arts and sciences. The balance assures graduates of a solid understanding of business and modern society along with a command of critical skills in decision-making and organizational leadership. Rotman Commerce graduates frequently become economists, accountants, actuaries, financial analysts, marketing analysts, managers of firms and government, or proprietors of small businesses. Some Rotman Commerce students elect to undertake post-graduate studies in the form of further university education: law schools and MBA programs have been particularly favoured destinations of recent graduates.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Finance and Economics Specialist (BCom) - ASSPE2038,"Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto offers an innovative curriculum combining studies in management, economics, and the liberal arts for an enriched professional undergraduate experience. The program explores the role of commerce in modern society while developing skill and confidence in analysis, effective communication, and decision making. The Rotman Commerce program offers a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree in three different specialist programs, Finance & Economics, Accounting, and Management. All programs within the Bachelor of Commerce degree build on a common foundation of business and liberal arts courses. Rotman Commerce students specialize in one of three programs: Accounting, Finance and Economics, or Management. Each program combines courses in management and applied economics with a variety of advanced courses in the liberal arts and sciences. The balance assures graduates of a solid understanding of business and modern society along with a command of critical skills in decision-making and organizational leadership. Rotman Commerce graduates frequently become economists, accountants, actuaries, financial analysts, marketing analysts, managers of firms and government, or proprietors of small businesses. Some Rotman Commerce students elect to undertake post-graduate studies in the form of further university education: law schools and MBA programs have been particularly favoured destinations of recent graduates.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Focus in Theory of Computation (Major) - ASFOC1689R,"(3.5 credits) Why is it easy to sort a list of numbers, but hard to break Internet encryption schemes? Is finding a solution to a problem harder than checking that a solution is correct? Can we find good approximate solutions, even when the exact solutions seem out of reach? Theory of Computation studies the inherent complexity of fundamental algorithmic problems. On one hand, we develop ground-breaking efficient data structures and algorithms. On the other, we have yet to develop good algorithms for many problems despite decades of effort, and for these problems we strive to prove no time- or space-efficient algorithms will ever solve them. While the field has seen some successful impossibility results, there are still many problems (such as those underlying modern cryptography and security) for which we do not know either efficient algorithms or strong lower bounds! This focus takes a rigorous, mathematical approach to computational problem-solving: students will gain a deep understanding of algorithm paradigms and measures of problem complexity, and develop the skills necessary to convey abstract ideas with precision and clarity. Many of our students go on to graduate studies and sophisticated algorithmic work in industry. This focus has natural ties with many branches of mathematics and is the foundation of many computer science fields. Consequently, our students often apply their theoretical knowledge to other fields of interest. We advise you to take  CSC240H1 and  CSC265H1, the enriched versions of  CSC236H1 and  CSC263H1, because these courses are particularly well-aligned with the goals of this focus and will best prepare you for advanced theory courses.

Human Geography Major (Arts Program) - ASMAJ1667,"The Human Geography programs provide the opportunity to learn about the relations between landscapes, places, people and nature, and the spatial organization of human activities. While students are encouraged to explore the breadth of the discipline, we also identify courses by theme for students who wish to develop expertise in one or two subfields (e.g., urban geography, cultural and historical geography). The Human Geography programs appeal to students who wish to develop an integrative understanding of the cultural, economic, political and social forces that shape how people use and experience the environments they live in. These programs offer training in quantitative and qualitative research methods, including GIS and Remote Sensing. Note: Double majors in Geography may only overlap 1.0 credit. Students combining any of our Minor programs with a Major Geography program will normally be allowed to overlap only 1.5 credits towards both programs.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Human Geography Major (Arts Program) - ASMAJ1667,"The Human Geography programs provide the opportunity to learn about the relations between landscapes, places, people and nature, and the spatial organization of human activities. While students are encouraged to explore the breadth of the discipline, we also identify courses by theme for students who wish to develop expertise in one or two subfields (e.g., urban geography, cultural and historical geography). The Human Geography programs appeal to students who wish to develop an integrative understanding of the cultural, economic, political and social forces that shape how people use and experience the environments they live in. These programs offer training in quantitative and qualitative research methods, including GIS and Remote Sensing. Note: Double majors in Geography may only overlap 1.0 credit. Students combining any of our Minor programs with a Major Geography program will normally be allowed to overlap only 1.5 credits towards both programs.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Drawing on the strengths of faculty members in History, Economics, and Political Science, the International Relations Specialist Program offers a structured and interdisciplinary education.

In addition to applying through ACORN, students applying in their second year or later are asked to please contact the department directly at undergrad.pharmtox@utoronto.ca, specify which program you would like to be considered for, and provide your student number. Please consult the Arts & Science Program Toolkit for more information on program enrolment. Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) Students in this program have the option to request enrolment in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) stream. Students can apply for the ASIP stream after Year 1 (Year 2 entry) or after Year 2 (Year 3 entry, starting Fall 2024). Full details about ASIP, including student eligibility, selection and enrolment, are available in the ASIP section of the Arts & Science Academic Calendar. Please note that the majority of students enter ASIP in Fall term of Year 2. Space is more limited for Year 3 entry and there are program-specific year 3 entry enrolment requirements. Students applying for Year 3 entry must have been admitted to the Pharmacology Specialist in the Summer after Year 2 and completion of  PCL201H1 (with a minimum grade of 77%),  PSL300H1 and  PSL301H1. Notes: While it is difficult to predict what will be competitive course marks and average in a given year, based on previous years, the estimate is: course marks = mid 80s; average = mid 80s. Students wishing to enroll in the Pharmacology Specialist will initially apply to the Joint Specialist in Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology (ASSPE2340). After admission, students can then choose to transfer to the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist. First and second year courses are the same for all Specialist programs within the Department (ASSPE2082/ASSPE2340/ASSPE2573). Students cannot combine the Biomedical Toxicology Specialist with either departmental Major programs (Biomedical Toxicology or Pharmacology). Students wishing to enroll after their second year who have taken  PCL201H1 will be considered on a case by case basis. Successful completion of required pre-requisite courses is required to further enroll in upper level program courses. Students may not transfer to the Major program from the Specialist after completion of  PCL472Y1 or  INT300H1/​ INT301H1 in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP).","Completion Requirements: (14.5 credits) First Year:  BIO120H1,  BIO130H1, ( CHM135H1,  CHM136H1)/  CHM151Y1, and 1.0 credit from any combination of ( MAT135H1,  MAT136H1)/  MAT137Y1/​  MAT157Y1,  PHY131H1/​  PHY151H1,  PHY132H1/​  PHY152H1 (see NOTE 1) Students in this program have the option to enrol in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) stream.

Pharmacology Specialist (Science Program) - ASSPE2082,"Pharmacology is an integrative medical science that builds upon the core foundational disciplines of the basic life sciences. The Pharmacology Specialist program aims to provide students with an understanding of the therapeutic properties and clinical uses of externally administered chemical substances in the whole body, as well as the mechanisms of their actions and interactions with molecular, cellular and tissue targets. This understanding prepares students for a variety of either research-based or non-research-based careers, including positions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in government agencies, in research institutes and in universities. Students learn about both basic and clinical pharmacology through lectures, tutorials, laboratories and independent research projects. The senior research project course enables students to gain valuable research experience while working under the supervision of an individual faculty member in either a laboratory-based or a non-laboratory-based setting. Pharmacology (and its application in clinical therapeutics) plays a prominent role in society, and a comprehension of drug mechanisms and uses is fundamental to career success in the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and nursing. While some students take the Pharmacology Specialist program in preparation for these professional programs, students are advised to contact the respective Faculties directly for questions related to transfer credits.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Practical courses treat the experimental and computational aspects and complement the lecture courses. Physics concerns many of the most fundamental questions in our scientific understanding of the universe. What is the nature of matter and energy at the smallest scales? What are the physical processes that govern the Earth’s climate? What is the nature of light and how can it be controlled? How do the collective properties of solids emerge from those of individual atoms? How do biological processes organize themselves to maintain their survival? What is the structure and evolution of the Earth and the other planets? How can quantum information be used for computation? Physics seeks answers to these questions using a combination of theory, computation and precise experimental work, and the results find application across all of science.

Quantitative Biology Major (Science Program) - ASMAJ2368,"The Quantitative Biology Major program (8.0 credits) is designed for students with a deep interest in biology who wish to gain a strong grounding in quantitative methods and their application to biological questions. More than ever, advancements in biology, from the molecular through the organismal to the ecosystem level, require quantitative thinking and skills along with a strong understanding of biological processes. Interdisciplinary research that draws from the natural sciences, mathematics, statistics and computer science, is an important aspect of modern biology. This major provides foundations in biology and quantitative approaches used to test and advance biological knowledge, and is appropriate for students who wish to pursue a career or graduate studies in a broad range of life sciences, ranging from biomedical to conservation to epidemiology. The program is delivered through a mixture of classroom-learning and applied laboratory teaching, with an emphasis on understanding how quantitative methods inform our understanding of biology, and how they can be applied to test and develop new hypotheses. Students also have access to independent research opportunities that enhance professional skills, science communication, and the development and application of knowledge in quantitative biology. Quantitative Biology Major students have priority enrollment in EEB courses, but not in courses offered by other departments, such as STA, MAT, CSC, CSB and BCB.

Specialist in Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology (Science Program) - ASSPE2340,"Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology are complementary sciences, and the Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology Specialist combines the requirements of the two distinct specialist programs. The Specialist program integrates knowledge of pharmacology – the understanding of the therapeutic properties and clinical applications of externally administered chemical substances in the whole body and the mechanisms of their actions and interactions with their intended targets, while biomedical toxicology examines the harmful effects of exogenous chemicals on the health and behaviour of individuals and society, addressing drug safety and the adverse consequences of chemical exposure. Biomedical toxicology includes understanding the safety/toxicity of a wide array of chemicals (pharmaceutical preparations, herbal products, natural toxins and environmental contaminants) with a focus on their effects and adverse consequences on human health. Both Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology are integrative life sciences which build on the core foundational disciplines of the basic life sciences and the prominent role each science plays in society. A comprehension of the biological mechanisms of action and potential uses of chemicals are key to career success in the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and nursing. The Specialist program prepares students for a variety of job opportunities following its completion as well as for further study in graduate research or professional programs such as Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. (Note: Students interested in professional programs should contact the respective faculties to inquire about specific transfer credits.) Graduates of this rigorous program will have access to an impressive variety of job opportunities in either research-based or non-research-based careers, including scientific research in research institutes and in universities, positions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and chemical industries, forensic science, nutrition and food sciences, government or consulting agencies. Students learn about both basic and clinical pharmacology and biomedical toxicology through lectures, tutorials, small group sessions, laboratories and independent research projects. The senior research project course enables students to gain valuable research experience while working under the supervision of an individual faculty member in either a laboratory-based or a non-laboratory-based setting.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program. Students must have completed 4.0 credits and meet the requirements listed below to enrol. Variable Minimum Grade or Variable Minimum Grade AverageA minimum grade/minimum grade average in required courses is needed for entry, and this minimum changes each year depending on available spaces and the number of applicants.

Students who have completed at least 8.0 credits but who are not already enrolled in ASSPE2340 must apply using the following courses:  BIO120H1 and  BIO130H1 ( CHM135H1,  CHM136H1)/  CHM151Y1 1.0 credit from ( MAT135H1 and  MAT136H1)/  MAT137Y1/​  MAT157Y1/​ ( PHY131H1 and  PHY132H1)/ ( PHY151H1 and  PHY152H1)  PCL201H1 To ensure that students admitted to the program will be successful, applicants with a final grade lower than 65% in each course, or a combined grade average lower than 75% in these required courses will not be considered for admission. Please note that obtaining this minimum final grade or minimum grade average does not guarantee admission to the program. The underlying numeric final mark in each of your courses required for program enrolment will be used by the relevant academic unit to determine your eligibility. Applications from students lacking numerical grades in one or more of the specified prerequisites, or students applying in their second or later years, may be considered on the basis of their entire academic record and the availability of space in the program. In addition to applying through ACORN, students applying in their second year or later are asked to please contact the department directly at undergrad.pharmtox@utoronto.ca, specify which program you would like to be considered for, and provide your student number. Please consult the Arts & Science Program Toolkit for more information on program enrolment. Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) Students in this program have the option to request enrolment in the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP) stream. Students can apply for the ASIP stream after Year 1 (Year 2 entry) or after Year 2 (Year 3 entry, starting Fall 2024). Full details about ASIP, including student eligibility, selection and enrolment, are available in the ASIP section of the Arts & Science Academic Calendar. Please note that the majority of students enter ASIP in Fall term of Year 2. Space is more limited for Year 3 entry and there are program-specific year 3 entry enrolment requirements. Students applying for Year 3 entry must have been admitted to the Specialist in Pharmacology and Biomedical Toxicology in the Summer after Year 2 and completion of  PCL201H1 (with a minimum grade of 77%),  PSL300H1 and  PSL301H1.

Specialist in Statistical Science: Methods and Practice (Science Program) - ASSPE2270,"Statistical Science encompasses methods and tools for obtaining knowledge from data and for understanding the uncertainty associated with this knowledge. The purposes of the undergraduate programs are to: (1) equip students with a general framework for obtaining knowledge from data; (2) give students skills that they are able to flexibly apply to a variety of problems; and (3) to provide students with the ability to learn new methods as needs, data sources, and technology change. The Specialist Program in Statistical Science: Methods and Practice is distinguished from the specialist program in Statistical Science: Theory and Methods through its emphasis on collaborative statistical practice and advanced exposure to an allied discipline. The program includes fundamental concepts in probability and statistical theory with mathematical prerequisites relevant to statistical practice. Students in the program acquire advanced expertise in statistical reasoning, methods, and computation, and complete a focus in another discipline that permits students to become conversant in that discipline to the extent that they can effectively collaborate. Students will also acquire advanced skills in communication, consultation and collaboration and an understanding of the role of mathematical thinking to support the development and evaluate the properties of statistical methods.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.

Specialist in Statistical Science: Methods and Practice (Science Program) - ASSPE2270,"Statistical Science encompasses methods and tools for obtaining knowledge from data and for understanding the uncertainty associated with this knowledge. The purposes of the undergraduate programs are to: (1) equip students with a general framework for obtaining knowledge from data; (2) give students skills that they are able to flexibly apply to a variety of problems; and (3) to provide students with the ability to learn new methods as needs, data sources, and technology change. The Specialist Program in Statistical Science: Methods and Practice is distinguished from the specialist program in Statistical Science: Theory and Methods through its emphasis on collaborative statistical practice and advanced exposure to an allied discipline. The program includes fundamental concepts in probability and statistical theory with mathematical prerequisites relevant to statistical practice. Students in the program acquire advanced expertise in statistical reasoning, methods, and computation, and complete a focus in another discipline that permits students to become conversant in that discipline to the extent that they can effectively collaborate. Students will also acquire advanced skills in communication, consultation and collaboration and an understanding of the role of mathematical thinking to support the development and evaluate the properties of statistical methods.","Enrolment Requirements: This is a limited enrolment program.
